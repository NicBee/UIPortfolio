# Hello

>I'm Nicole. UI and UX Designer. Welcome to my portfolio.
>
>Visual interaction design is where my passion lies. While attending university, I focused 
on my degree program, Game Programming and Development, but I fell in love with UI. I 
love doing research into the whys and whats of how people felt about certain things and 
how to make their needs come to life. After finishing my degree, I came to realize that I 
was inadvertently always working on UI and doing best design practices. Before 
working on assignments, I would do research into what people liked the most and what 
they struggled with, focusing on colors and actions. I would then outline (wireframe) how 
I wanted my applications and games to look and feel to my targeted audience. I would 
annotate within the programs what was working and what needed to be fixed, while 
adding what additional items I would like to include, such as further interactivity or better 
clarification of button functionality. At the end of my degree program, I worked as the 
UI/UX engineer and designer for my gaming group and solidified my love for all things 
UI.

![HUD](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/HUD.png?raw=true "Check Out That HUD")

My first official work as a UI/UX designer and engineer. The game we were creating, 
which I named ‘The Imaginarium’, was about a kid named Sam who was told to clean 
up their room. Being a kid, Sam would grow bored of doing their chores, and would 
often space out while picking up the toys. When Sam spaced out, they imagined they 
were in a castle, fighting bad guys, jumping over lava pits and their goal was to reach 
the treasure chest. I worked as the only audio engineer, story editor, HUD programmer,
and UI/UX designer and engineer. 

To succeed in designing the HUD, to reflect our target audience of children, I not only 
asked my children what their needs and wants were, but I also did some research 
online, viewing the various games with the same targeted audience. I deemed a simple 
HUD of just showing Sam’s stamina and health, along with the arrows and keys they 
can pick up, to be effective. With the health bar, the green bar depletes as Sam gets 
injured, and in its’ place is a gray bar, showing children that their health is decreasing; 
the same goes for the stamina bar, as Sam attacks with their bow or sword or sprints. To 
tell apart the health and stamina, I chose different bold colors that pop out on the 
screen, no matter the location of Sam; I also displayed a heart, to help indicate that the 
top green bar was for health, and a swirl blue ball, to help indicate Sam’s stamina.

![Personality](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/Personality.png?raw=true "What A Personality")

Being the storyteller of the game, the team and I talked about the type of personality the 
game should have. Knowing how children love their jokes, we decided to add some 
comedy to the game, making it a bit more light-hearted than it was originally. Since our 
game lacked spoken dialogue, I decided to add some written dialogue to the various 
chests and doors throughout the castle area. If Sam approached the door without 
picking up a key, the following text would show. With the demographic of the game 
being geared toward younger children, the ages 10 and below, the text had to be kept 
simple so everyone of reading age could understand it. The image provided also 
displays the health bar depleting and the number of arrows the player has picked up.

![The Imaginarium](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/The%20Imaginarium.png?raw=true "The Feeling of Being Whole")

Working on the UI and UX of the game meant I not only controlled the overall feel of the game but also had to create the menus and opening screens. For people who have played the game, the intro screen isn’t completely recognizable; during the lava section, Sam is jumping over rocks without any enemies (aside from flying lava balls) and they’re always holding a sword. I had to manipulate the level design to include not only the enemy seen on the rock in the middle but also the enemy hidden to the left of Sam with the bow and arrow. I then pulled the character model from the house and placed it in the lava section. I also had to angle the camera and wait for the steam to trigger to create an ominous feeling before I took a screenshot for the game cover. I chose to do all of this to grab the target audience’s attention. Having the bright red of the lava illuminate the main character’s profile while the steam keeps the background semi-hidden makes children feel like this is going to be an epic adventure; it brings excitement and makes them feel like this game will be a challenge, which will bring a sense of accomplishment if/when the game is beaten.

Along with the opening screen, I had to create functioning buttons. I researched the various kids’ games opening screens, to see how and where they placed their buttons and how their buttons functioned. Feeling inspired, I made it so that when the player hovers over the button, it brightly illuminates, hiding the cover image. I made a wireframe of how I thought the menus should look (Opening, How to Play, Credits, Pause) and showed them to my team, which was unanimously approved.

![The To Do List](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/todolist_.jpg?raw=true "Simple But Effective")
![Interactivity](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/Interactivity.jpg?raw=true "Making It Work")

This project I created mostly from scratch. I was provided the basic code functionality, but I had free reign of the look and feel of the application. I asked my friends what kind of to-do list application they would use and what they wouldn’t use or wouldn’t like. With their provided feedback, I chose to keep the app simple by providing the users with only a couple of buttons: Show All Tasks, Add New, and Complete Task. I created a rough outline of how I wanted the app to look and made a quick prototype to show my professor. After getting approval, I used the code the class provided and put together the app. While placing the code, I annotated how I wanted the menus to look and how the headers and footers should be structured, as a reminder. I also documented what interactivity I wanted the app to have; since this was a mobile app, I had to remember that users can typically use their fingers for touch screens, and in case they couldn’t, they’d have to have the ability to scroll and click on buttons with a mouse. 

I chose darker colors to show a sense of professionalism. When the user adds a task, I change the colors to bright yellow and orange, to show there’s something they need to complete, as showcased in the following two images. I also decided to add bold red text, indicating to the user that their task is due soon.

![Wireframing It 1](https://github.com/NicBee/UIPortfolio/blob/main/Wireframing%20It%201.JPG?raw=true "How It Started")

For this class, we were told to make a website for a restaurant of our choice, from the provided 3 choices; with the choices, we were provided rough outlines of the type of restaurant along with their color palette. I chose a restaurant called Pasta Amore, which was focused on homemade Italian food, with a bright red, green, and tan color palette. To get inspiration, I looked up various Italian restaurants, to get a feel of how they placed their objects, buttons, menus, etc. Instead of working on the coding right away, I decided to draw a rough outline of how I’d like the website layout to look. At the time, I wasn’t aware that what I was doing was actually making a wireframe. The first image was the original idea that I had; I wanted to include a calendar that indicated if the business was ever closed because of a holiday or otherwise; I also wanted to create a small web banner that could be used for displaying affiliates. When I started using HTML and CSS to create the website, I ran out of time to figure out how to create a functioning calendar, so I had to come up with a new plan. The second image was created with slightly more details based on my coding capabilities. After replacing the calendar with more user reviews, I also focused on new functionality for the website, with an automatic scroll for the special of the day, which allows users to decide if they want to wait for a specific item on a specific day. In the end, I made all of the buttons on the website fully functional and adhered to the color palette limitations, and made an appealing website for customers to enjoy.

While my portfolio might be lacking, I am currently trying to improve my UI skills. I am taking classes through LinkedIn Learning. User experience interaction has become such a love of my life and I’m so grateful for anyone who has taken the time to look over my portfolio. Here’s to hoping we can work together soon!

Thank you.
